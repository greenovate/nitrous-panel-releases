## What Makes Nitrous Panel Different?

Other brightness apps boost brightness but **wash out blacks**. They lift shadow detail and reduce contrast - making your display look worse, not better.

**Nitrous Panel is the only app with Deep Blacks mode:** Preserve true black levels while boosting brightness to 1600 nits. Get brilliant highlights AND rich shadows.

| Other Apps | Nitrous Panel |
|:----------:|:-------------:|
| ❌ Washed out blacks | ✅ True deep blacks |
| ❌ Reduced contrast | ✅ Enhanced contrast |
| ❌ Gamma hacks | ✅ Native API control |
| ❌ Fake brightness | ✅ Real 1600 nits |
